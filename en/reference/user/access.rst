=============

Access right allows to control some specific setting of your system.

    :align: center

For example, we have two options for Page object:

.. image:: /images/access_2.png
    :align: center

* "Show_views" is an action that allow to view counter of current page.
* "Page_footer" is an option that store some additional html for page.

Each of these option is connected to current selected role "Admin" (right top corner). You can set this up for each role.

To make it clear look at another example:

.. image:: /images/access_3.png
    :align: center

Here is defined admin access for role "Admin" you can change it.

Text like "ACTION_ADMINAREA_ACCESS_DESCRIPTION" are placeholders and can be changed in language management system.
