Welcome to PhalconEye's documentation!
======================================

PhalconEye CMS is based on Phalcon PHP Framework. It contains basic building blocks for rapid development: modules, widgets, plugins and themes.

Originally, it has been designed to help web developers kickstart their projects, and therefore it is more a development
platform then general purpose Content Management Systems unlike others you might already be familiar with such as Joomla or Wordpress.

What is Phalcon?
----------------
Phalcon_ is an open source, full stack framework for PHP 5 written as a C-extension, optimized for high performance.
You don't need to learn or use the C language, since the functionality is exposed as PHP classes ready for you to use.
Phalcon also is loosely coupled, allowing you to use its objects as glue components based on the needs of your application.

Phalcon is not only about performance, our goal is to make it robust, rich in features and easy to use!
